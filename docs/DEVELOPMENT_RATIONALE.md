# Tactica — Development Rationale

A running log of **why** decisions were made — not just *what* changed, but the
reasoning/discussion behind it. Companion to `ECONOMY.md` / `MODULES.md` (which
describe the *current* state); this explains *how we got there*.

**Conventions (see `CLAUDE.md` for the binding rule):**
- **Append-only.** Never overwrite or delete prior entries.
- New entries carry a **date** and **author**. If a decision supersedes an
  earlier one, add a new dated entry noting it supersedes the prior — keep both,
  so two contributors' reasoning and the evolution over time are all preserved.

> The entries below are the **initial batch (2026-06-23)**, reconstructed from the
> design discussion to date. Dated/attributed entries begin after this batch.

## Process & collaboration

- **Work is split into modules, not "owned" branches.** Two people (the author +
  brother Patrick) work on separate machines and sync via GitHub. The goal is to
  avoid merge clashes. Key realization: *git branches don't isolate work — files
  do.* Two people clash only when they edit the same lines of the same file.
  → So features get their **own files**, edits to shared files stay small/additive,
  and we sync often. See `MODULES.md`.

- **New feature → new files; cross-references via an overlay.** The economy lives
  in its own `economy.ts` / `economy.json` / `economy.test.ts`, touching shared
  core (`types.ts`, `game.ts`) only with tiny additive hooks. When economy needed
  a per-unit plasma cost, it kept that in *its own* `economy.json` (`unitPlasmaCost`)
  rather than editing the combat module's `units.json`.
  → Avoids the highest-risk clash source (two people editing the same JSON objects).

- **Docs live in the repo so they sync and survive.** Local chat transcripts are
  on one machine only; committing design docs to GitHub is the durable, shared
  backup and the way to inform other sessions/contributors.

## Economy

- **Unit upkeep was explored, then parked (not deleted).** First idea for limiting
  army size was per-turn gold upkeep (economic pressure; bankruptcy → desertion).
  Once we chose Polytopia-style **unit slots** (a hard cap per city), upkeep became
  redundant — real Polytopia has no upkeep. Kept the code dormant
  (`upkeepMultiplier: 0`) rather than throwing it away.
  → Two mechanisms solving the same problem (limit army size) would double-punish;
  the slot cap does the job.

- **Polytopia-style economy chosen.** The author wanted an economy "almost
  identical to Polytopia": cities that produce currency per turn and level up, with
  unit capacity tied to city level.

- **Two resources: ore + plasma** (StarCraft minerals/gas analogy). Ore is the base
  currency for basic units/buildings; plasma is the advanced resource for high-tech
  units/buildings, gated behind tech.

- **`shard` → `ore` rename.** Ore became the primary-resource name. Flagged as a
  *shared-contract* change: mapgen (Patrick's side) must emit `resourceKind: 'ore'`/
  `'plasma'`, and the engine reads it with a safe fallback (untagged resource tiles
  treated as ore) so nothing breaks before mapgen catches up.

- **"pop" vs "supply" — a deliberate terminology split.** These were swapped from an
  earlier draft to match the author's mental model:
  - **pop** = unit *capacity* (how many units a city can support) = level + 1.
  - **supply** = the *leveling currency* accumulated from buildings; crossing
    thresholds raises the city's level (and therefore pop).
  → Getting this vocabulary fixed early prevents confusion across the codebase.

- **Supply thresholds 2 / 5 / 9 / 14 / 20 (incremental +2/+3/+4/+5/+6).** The cost
  to level rises each tier. Reasoning surfaced from the "8 surrounding tiles" math:
  a 3×3 territory can't hold enough basic buildings to reach high levels, so high
  levels must come from *deeper* sources (upgraded mines, refineries), not just more
  mines. This is intentional friction, to be eased later by a future supply building.

- **REBs do two things: produce a resource AND add supply.** Unlike Polytopia (where
  a lone resource building does nothing until it completes a level), our buildings
  generate income immediately *and* contribute to leveling.
  → Splits "income now" from "growth over time" and makes every build meaningful.

- **REB1 vs REB2.** REB1 (mine/extractor) = self output + supply by level. REB2
  (refinery/purifier) = output + supply *per adjacent same-city REB1*, i.e. they
  amplify nearby extraction. REB2 upgrades are pricier/steeper to gate power.

- **TTR (turns-to-return) as a balance lens.** "How many turns until a building pays
  for itself." Used to reason about pacing; TTR rises with building level (2 → 4 → 6)
  so higher tiers pay back slower — throttles snowballing. Tech-gating REB1 upgrades
  is the other throttle.

- **Bug fix — capture makes units stateless.** When a city is captured, the previous
  owner's units homed there have their home-city link cleared, so they don't occupy
  the new owner's unit slots. No stat penalty yet (a penalty for stateless units is
  on the backlog).

- **Bug fix — REB2 is same-city only.** A refinery/purifier counts only adjacent
  REB1s belonging to its own city (cross-city drawing deferred to a future tech).

- **Removed vestigial gold/income config.** The old tile-based income system
  (`cityIncome`, `resourceIncome`, `startingGold`, `calculateIncome`) was replaced by
  city-production income, so it was deleted — "no more mention of gold."

- **Refinery rename + extractor cap removed (latest).** REB2 ore building renamed
  `processor` → `refinery`. The "extractor: max 1 per city" cap was removed — building
  counts should be governed by how many ore/plasma tiles the map spawns, not a hard
  per-city cap.

## Tech

- **Tech = data + a generic modifier system, not code scattered across modules.**
  Tech is cross-cutting (one tech can affect combat, economy, units, pathing). To stop
  it sprawling and causing clashes: the tech tree is *data* (`tech-tree.json`), effects
  are a *small generic vocabulary* read via `getModifier()`, and each module names the
  tech it cares about *in its own data, by string id* (e.g. economy's `techRequired`).
  → **The one rule:** never hardcode a tech id inside a module's logic; always go
  through the generic modifier/unlock check.

- **Old tech tree cleared to start fresh.** The existing 8 techs were mostly inert
  (their modifiers weren't read by any code). Deleted the dead `taxation`/`diplomacy`
  first, then cleared the rest to design a real tree from scratch.

- **6 branches × 3 levels; identical for both teams (for now).** Branches:
  Refinement, Logistics, Intel, Maneuver, Armory, Assault. Teams share the tree
  initially; per-faction tweaks come after testing. (Branch 1 was called "Economy"
  during design, renamed to "Refinement" to avoid confusion with the economy module.)

- **Branch-based prerequisites (for now).** Researching any level-1 tech in a branch
  unlocks all level-2 in that branch; any level-2 unlocks all level-3. Simple to start;
  richer prereqs (e.g. some L3 needs 2 L2) are on the backlog.

- **Tech cost scales with city count (anti-tech-rush).** Polytopia model. Base cost
  L1/L2/L3 = 50/60/70 with one city, +10/+20/+30 per additional city, computed at
  research time. → Prevents rushing tech; expanding makes future tech pricier
  (a deliberate tradeoff between expansion and research).

## Dated entries

### 2026-06-23 — Artisan Ornaments — tech system + Refinement branch (L1–L2)

- **Built the tech engine.** `TechDef` now carries `branch` + `level` (flat
  `cost` removed — cost is derived). New `tech-config.json` holds the cost curve
  (base 50/60/70 by level, +10/+20/+30 per extra city). New `engine/src/tech.ts`
  module owns `getModifier` (moved out of game.ts so all modules share one reader),
  `techCost`, and `isTechAvailable` (the branch-unlock rule: any L(n-1) in a branch
  unlocks all L(n)). *Why:* implement the confirmed framework while keeping tech as
  data + generic modifiers so it doesn't cross-cut into other modules.
- **Refinement branch (L1–L2).** Drilling, Prospecting (L1); Slag Wash, Plasma Tap,
  Refineries (L2). *Gating is owned by the economy data*, not tech code: mine's
  `upgradeTechRequired`, extractor's & refinery's `techRequired` name the tech ids —
  no tech id is hardcoded in economy logic. Slag Wash is a `mineOutputBonus` modifier
  the economy reads. L3 deferred for beta.
- **Prospecting scaffolded only.** Its reveal effect lives in fog/mapgen (Patrick's
  module) and fog is off; logged to `docs/overlap.md` for him to wire later.
- **Branch 1 renamed Economy → Refinement** to avoid confusion with the economy module.

### 2026-06-23 — Artisan Ornaments — Armory branch (tech scaffolding only)

- **Armory is mostly Patrick's module.** Of 9 techs, 8 unlock units or combat
  mechanics (Combat & units); only Replicator is economy. *Decision:* the economy/
  tech branch builds only the **tech scaffolding** (entries, unlock gates, generic
  combat modifiers as data); Patrick implements the combat/unit/status/fog guts from
  `docs/overlap.md`. Keeps tech non-cross-cutting.
- **Unit-unlock mechanism wired.** A unit is recruitable unless a tech `unlockUnit`
  effect names it and that tech is unresearched (Warrior/Scout stay always-available).
  Small Arms→Marksman, Triage→Medic, Forge→Tank, Mech Bay→Stalker. The units don't
  exist in `units.json` yet (Patrick), so they're simply unbuildable until added —
  forward-compatible.
- **Combat bonuses as generic modifiers** (`focusFireBonus`, `assaultRangeBonus`,
  `heavyDefenceBonus`) — data only; combat reads them via getModifier when built.
- **Locked/preview techs.** Added `TechDef.locked`; the engine never offers locked
  techs for research. The three Armory L3s (Reactive Plating, Tracer Rounds,
  Replicator) are locked previews — *why:* the user wants the full tree visible but
  these gated until their (heavy) implementations exist. UI greying logged to overlap.
- **Replicator deferred** to a dedicated task (first timed-construction + first
  out-of-city unit production) — backlog, not built.
- **Armory L1/L2 left researchable despite being inert for now** (decision: leave
  as-is; Patrick will plug in the units + stats shortly). Known side effect: greedy
  self-play sims go drawish because the bot wastes ore researching not-yet-implemented
  Armory techs — a bot artifact, not an engine bug (36 tests pass, determinism holds).
  Resolves once Patrick wires the units/effects.

### 2026-06-27 — Artisan Ornaments — map distributions (ruins, ore, plasma)

The map's ruin/resource generation, now locked in (mapgen.ts):

- **Territory spacing.** Every city/ruin owns a **3×3 territory** and territories
  **never overlap** — the minimum centre-to-centre distance is **3** (the two 3×3
  squares just touching). New ruins target a centre distance of **3 / 4 / 5** from
  the nearest existing centre, weighted **25 / 50 / 25**, and fill the map at that
  spacing (emergent count). *Why:* the whole pop/supply economy assumes one tile
  belongs to exactly one city, so overlapping territories are disallowed.
- **Per-capital resources** (unchanged): **2 ore + 1 plasma** vent in the capital's
  territory.
- **Ruin ore:** number of ore tiles in a ruin's territory = **0/1/2/3/4** with
  weights **10/20/50/25/5**. (Those sum to 110, so they're applied as *relative
  weights*, normalised — preserving the intended shape: mostly 2 ore.)
- **Ruin plasma:** plasma vents in a ruin's territory = **0/1/2** with weights
  **35/50/15**.

All generation is deterministic via the map PRNG (same seed → identical map).

### 2026-06-27 — Artisan Ornaments — territory ownership & resource capture

- **Founded cities claim their full 3×3 territory** (ownership only — terrain and
  resources preserved), matching capitals. Previously only the centre tile was
  owned, so the red territory border rendered as a single square.
- **Removed lone-resource capture on move.** Stepping a unit onto a resource tile
  no longer sets ownership. *Why:* it was leftover from the old tile-income economy
  and now only drew a stray 1-tile territory border. Resources are owned by being
  inside a city's claimed territory, not by standing on them.

### 2026-06-27 — Artisan Ornaments — melee advance & delayed city capture

- **Melee advance on kill.** A melee unit (attackRange 1) that kills its target
  moves onto the target's tile (Polytopia-style). Ranged units don't advance.
- **City capture is no longer instant.** Moving onto an enemy/neutral city no
  longer captures it. Instead, a unit standing on an enemy city can capture it via
  an explicit `captureCity` action — but only when it *didn't move onto the city
  that turn* (eligibility = on enemy city AND `!hasMoved`), so capture becomes
  available the **following** turn. In the UI, selecting the unit shows a
  "Capture City?" box. Capturing transfers the city, its 3×3 territory, and its
  buildings to the captor (buildings keep their cityId, so output follows the new
  owner); the previous owner's units homed there go stateless.
  *Tech-on-capture handling is deferred — see the memory backlog.*

*Deferred ideas (the "we'll tweak this later" items) live in the memory backlog,
surfaced on request — they are design intentions, not yet decisions.*
