# Tactica — Development Rationale

A running log of **why** decisions were made — not just *what* changed, but the
reasoning/discussion behind it. New entries are appended as design decisions are
made. Newest sections at the bottom of each area. (Companion to `ECONOMY.md`,
`MODULES.md`, which describe the *current* state; this explains *how we got there*.)

## Process & collaboration

- **Work is split into modules, not "owned" branches.** Two people (the author +
  brother Patrick) work on separate machines and sync via GitHub. The goal is to
  avoid merge clashes. Key realization: *git branches don't isolate work — files
  do.* Two people clash only when they edit the same lines of the same file.
  → So features get their **own files**, edits to shared files stay small/additive,
  and we sync often. See `MODULES.md`.

- **New feature → new files; cross-references via an overlay.** The economy lives
  in its own `economy.ts` / `economy.json` / `economy.test.ts`, touching shared
  core (`types.ts`, `game.ts`) only with tiny additive hooks. When economy needed
  a per-unit plasma cost, it kept that in *its own* `economy.json` (`unitPlasmaCost`)
  rather than editing the combat module's `units.json`.
  → Avoids the highest-risk clash source (two people editing the same JSON objects).

- **Docs live in the repo so they sync and survive.** Local chat transcripts are
  on one machine only; committing design docs to GitHub is the durable, shared
  backup and the way to inform other sessions/contributors.

## Economy

- **Unit upkeep was explored, then parked (not deleted).** First idea for limiting
  army size was per-turn gold upkeep (economic pressure; bankruptcy → desertion).
  Once we chose Polytopia-style **unit slots** (a hard cap per city), upkeep became
  redundant — real Polytopia has no upkeep. Kept the code dormant
  (`upkeepMultiplier: 0`) rather than throwing it away.
  → Two mechanisms solving the same problem (limit army size) would double-punish;
  the slot cap does the job.

- **Polytopia-style economy chosen.** The author wanted an economy "almost
  identical to Polytopia": cities that produce currency per turn and level up, with
  unit capacity tied to city level.

- **Two resources: ore + plasma** (StarCraft minerals/gas analogy). Ore is the base
  currency for basic units/buildings; plasma is the advanced resource for high-tech
  units/buildings, gated behind tech.

- **`shard` → `ore` rename.** Ore became the primary-resource name. Flagged as a
  *shared-contract* change: mapgen (Patrick's side) must emit `resourceKind: 'ore'`/
  `'plasma'`, and the engine reads it with a safe fallback (untagged resource tiles
  treated as ore) so nothing breaks before mapgen catches up.

- **"pop" vs "supply" — a deliberate terminology split.** These were swapped from an
  earlier draft to match the author's mental model:
  - **pop** = unit *capacity* (how many units a city can support) = level + 1.
  - **supply** = the *leveling currency* accumulated from buildings; crossing
    thresholds raises the city's level (and therefore pop).
  → Getting this vocabulary fixed early prevents confusion across the codebase.

- **Supply thresholds 2 / 5 / 9 / 14 / 20 (incremental +2/+3/+4/+5/+6).** The cost
  to level rises each tier. Reasoning surfaced from the "8 surrounding tiles" math:
  a 3×3 territory can't hold enough basic buildings to reach high levels, so high
  levels must come from *deeper* sources (upgraded mines, refineries), not just more
  mines. This is intentional friction, to be eased later by a future supply building.

- **REBs do two things: produce a resource AND add supply.** Unlike Polytopia (where
  a lone resource building does nothing until it completes a level), our buildings
  generate income immediately *and* contribute to leveling.
  → Splits "income now" from "growth over time" and makes every build meaningful.

- **REB1 vs REB2.** REB1 (mine/extractor) = self output + supply by level. REB2
  (refinery/purifier) = output + supply *per adjacent same-city REB1*, i.e. they
  amplify nearby extraction. REB2 upgrades are pricier/steeper to gate power.

- **TTR (turns-to-return) as a balance lens.** "How many turns until a building pays
  for itself." Used to reason about pacing; TTR rises with building level (2 → 4 → 6)
  so higher tiers pay back slower — throttles snowballing. Tech-gating REB1 upgrades
  is the other throttle.

- **Bug fix — capture makes units stateless.** When a city is captured, the previous
  owner's units homed there have their home-city link cleared, so they don't occupy
  the new owner's unit slots. No stat penalty yet (a penalty for stateless units is
  on the backlog).

- **Bug fix — REB2 is same-city only.** A refinery/purifier counts only adjacent
  REB1s belonging to its own city (cross-city drawing deferred to a future tech).

- **Removed vestigial gold/income config.** The old tile-based income system
  (`cityIncome`, `resourceIncome`, `startingGold`, `calculateIncome`) was replaced by
  city-production income, so it was deleted — "no more mention of gold."

- **Refinery rename + extractor cap removed (latest).** REB2 ore building renamed
  `processor` → `refinery`. The "extractor: max 1 per city" cap was removed — building
  counts should be governed by how many ore/plasma tiles the map spawns, not a hard
  per-city cap.

## Tech

- **Tech = data + a generic modifier system, not code scattered across modules.**
  Tech is cross-cutting (one tech can affect combat, economy, units, pathing). To stop
  it sprawling and causing clashes: the tech tree is *data* (`tech-tree.json`), effects
  are a *small generic vocabulary* read via `getModifier()`, and each module names the
  tech it cares about *in its own data, by string id* (e.g. economy's `techRequired`).
  → **The one rule:** never hardcode a tech id inside a module's logic; always go
  through the generic modifier/unlock check.

- **Old tech tree cleared to start fresh.** The existing 8 techs were mostly inert
  (their modifiers weren't read by any code). Deleted the dead `taxation`/`diplomacy`
  first, then cleared the rest to design a real tree from scratch.

- **6 branches × 3 levels; identical for both teams (for now).** Branches: Economy,
  Logistics, Intel, Maneuver, Armory, Assault. Teams share the tree initially;
  per-faction tweaks come after testing.

- **Branch-based prerequisites (for now).** Researching any level-1 tech in a branch
  unlocks all level-2 in that branch; any level-2 unlocks all level-3. Simple to start;
  richer prereqs (e.g. some L3 needs 2 L2) are on the backlog.

- **Tech cost scales with city count (anti-tech-rush).** Polytopia model. Base cost
  L1/L2/L3 = 50/60/70 with one city, +10/+20/+30 per additional city, computed at
  research time. → Prevents rushing tech; expanding makes future tech pricier
  (a deliberate tradeoff between expansion and research).

*Deferred ideas (the "we'll tweak this later" items) live in the memory backlog,
surfaced on request — they are design intentions, not yet decisions.*
